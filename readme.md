# statusline.vim

This is my own Vim statusline. I built it to be fast and simple.

* It is not configurable; it is already perfect, so there is nothing to be
  configured.
* It includes a ruler that displays limited information, thus affording one more
  line than would be available with `:set laststatus=2`.
* It displays the current Git branch without any dependencies.
* It makes use of Powerline fonts and there is no way to turn this off. If your
  terminal cannot properly render Powerline fonts, you probably need to switch to
  [**Source Code Pro**](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).

You probably shouldn't use it. You should probably use
[**lightline.vim**](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) instead.
